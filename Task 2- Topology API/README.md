API for TOPOLOGY JSON file.
Language choses: JAVA (with Maven build tool).
Reasons: Easy to manage multiple classes as well as has a good library to work with json files.
The API can read the JSON file, Write a new JSON file , Store all those topologies in a static ArrayList and can print all topologies found in this arraylist.
Delete a topology functionality has not been added yet :(
Run the main file to test the functionality with interactive choices in terminal.
