API for TOPOLOGY JSON file.

Language choses: JAVA (with Maven build tool).

Reasons: Easy to manage multiple classes as well as has a good library to work with json files.

The API can read the JSON file, Write a new JSON file , Store all those topologies in a static ArrayList and can print all topologies found in this arraylist.

Delete a topology functionality has not been added yet :(

Run the main file to test the functionality with interactive choices in terminal.
